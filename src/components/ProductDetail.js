                Doctor is one of the familiar professions for children,
                <br />
                so it's often a subject of play.
                <br />
                Have you ever yearned to use a stethoscope?
                <br />
                Introducing the Doctor Role Play Set that allows kids to enjoy
                imitating their beloved adults.

                It includes 5 basic medical instruments <br />
                (stethoscope, blood pressure monitor, syringe, thermometer, and
                shot gun) and a carry-on bag.
                <br />
                It runs to the patient anytime and anywhere.

                Imitating the doctor who is always examining and diagnosing
                people or stuffed animals!
                <br />
                The blood pressure monitor has a structure that makes a sound
                when you pump it.
                <br />
                It's fun to switch roles with family or friends, turning your
                home into a makeshift hospital.
                <br />
                If your child plays with this, he/she might get used to real
                check-ups and find them easier to accept.
